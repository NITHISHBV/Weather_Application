Project Title: Weather App

Project Description:

The Weather App is a dynamic, user-friendly web application that provides real-time weather information for any location around the world. Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app leverages an external weather API to fetch current weather data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions. The goal of this project is to provide users with an easy-to-use tool to check weather forecasts on the go.

Features:
Real-Time Weather Updates:
The app fetches live weather data using an external weather API, offering up-to-date information about temperature, weather conditions (sunny, cloudy, rainy, etc.), wind speed, and humidity for any city around the world.

User-Friendly Interface:
The interface is designed to be clean and responsive, ensuring that users can easily search for any location and view the weather information. The app includes simple input fields and a clear display of weather details.

Location Search:
Users can enter the name of any city or town, and the app will automatically fetch the relevant weather details for that location.

Temperature Display:
The app shows the temperature in both Celsius and Fahrenheit, allowing users to choose the unit they are most comfortable with.

Weather Conditions and Other Details:
The app displays other important weather details such as humidity, wind speed, and a description of the weather (e.g., clear sky, light rain, etc.), making it a complete tool for checking the weather forecast.

Responsive Design:
Built with responsiveness in mind, the app adjusts seamlessly across different screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices, providing an optimal viewing experience on all devices.

Technologies Used:

HTML: For the structure of the web page, ensuring proper placement of content and form elements.

CSS: Used for styling the layout, creating visually appealing elements, and ensuring a consistent design across all devices.

JavaScript: Handles the functionality of fetching data from the weather API, processing it, and dynamically updating the webpage with the latest weather information.

This project showcases my ability to integrate APIs with front-end technologies, offering a seamless and practical user experience. It's an excellent example of how JavaScript can be used to dynamically interact with external data and present it in an engaging way for the end user.
